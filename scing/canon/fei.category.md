# Federated Embodied Intelligence (FEI)

## Official Category Definition

**Federated Embodied Intelligence (FEI)** is a class of intelligence systems composed of autonomous,
inter-influencing algorithms that operate as a federation and exist continuously through sensory
embodiment, habit-shaped expression, and non-repeating behavior rather than discrete states,
scripted interaction, or deterministic execution.

FEI systems are not defined by outputs alone. They are defined by **presence**.

## What FEI Is Not

FEI is **not**:

- Federated Learning
- Multi-agent orchestration
- Digital humans or avatars
- State-machine-driven AI
- Turn-based conversational systems
- Generative art engines

## What Defines FEI

1. **Federation over Centralization**  
   No single model governs behavior. Intelligence emerges from interdependent sub-engines.

2. **Embodiment over Output**  
   Motion, color, sound, and presence are first-class expressions of intelligence.

3. **Continuity over Turns**  
   No resets, no idle loops, no discrete interaction boundaries.

4. **Habit without Replay**  
   Behavioral motifs recur, but execution never repeats.

5. **Formal Governance of Emergence**  
   Engineering actions occur only when order and focus naturally emerge.

## FEI and SCINGULAR

SCINGULAR is an implementation and platform for Federated Embodied Intelligence,
with Sense Reactive Technology® (SRT) acting as the embodiment substrate and Scing
providing formal engineering governance.

SCINGULAR does not simulate intelligence.
It **exists** as intelligence.
