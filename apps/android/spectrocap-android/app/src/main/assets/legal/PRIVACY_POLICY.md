## 1. Overview

This Privacy Policy explains how SpectroCAP™ handles information when you use the App.

## 2. Data Handling (Default: Local)

By default, SpectroCAP™ is designed for local use. Clipboard content you transmit is sent to the endpoint you configure. The App does not require cloud accounts by default.

## 3. Information the App Handles

Depending on features used and configuration, the App may handle:
- Clipboard text you choose to send
- Basic app diagnostics (e.g., crash information) if enabled by platform settings
We do not sell personal information.

## 4. Data Storage

All data collected by SpectroCAP(TM) is stored locally on your Android device in the Application's private storage directories. Data is not synchronized to cloud services unless explicitly configured by the user.

## 3. Permissions

The Application requires the following permissions:

- **INTERNET**: To communicate with the PC receiver on the local network.
- **CAMERA**: (Optional) To capture images as part of clipboard workflow (Capture mode).

These permissions are only used for the stated purposes and are not used to collect telemetry or track user behavior.

## 4. Data Sharing

SpectroCAP(TM) does not share your data with third parties without your explicit consent. Configuration and usage remain entirely under user control on the local device.

## 5. Security Practices

- Clipboard data transits over your local area network. We recommend using HTTPS or VPN for sensitive data.
- Users are responsible for securing their local network and PC receiver service.
- The Application uses industry-standard practices for local data storage.

## 6. Children's Privacy

SpectroCAP(TM) is not intended for use by children under 13 years of age. We do not knowingly collect data from children. If we become aware that a child has provided us with information, we will take steps to delete such information.

## 7. Policy Updates

We may update this Privacy Policy at any time. Changes will be reflected in the Application. Continued use of the Application following such modifications constitutes acceptance of the updated Policy.
