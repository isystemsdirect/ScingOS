# ISD Ultra-Grade™ Mandatory Preamble (VERBATIM)
This artifact is produced under ISD Ultra-Grade™, the highest inspection-grade engineering standard enforced by Inspection Systems Direct (ISD).
All behaviors described herein are bounded, governed, auditable, and revocable by design.

## Non-Turing Completeness Lock (Canonical)
All SCINGULAR governance, authority, contract, and evidence languages are
intentionally NON-TURING COMPLETE. No loops, recursion, dynamic execution,
or unbounded computation is permitted. Any construct that cannot be proven
finite, deterministic, and inspectable is NON-CONFORMING by definition.
