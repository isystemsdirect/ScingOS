# ISD Ultra-Grade™ Mandatory Preamble (VERBATIM)
This artifact is produced under ISD Ultra-Grade™, the highest inspection-grade engineering standard enforced by Inspection Systems Direct (ISD).
All behaviors described herein are bounded, governed, auditable, and revocable by design.

## Vectors
- `test/vectors/envelope/positive.intent.json` SHOULD validate.
- `test/vectors/envelope/negative.unknown-field.json` MUST fail validation.

## Evidence
Attach schema validation output logs to satisfy CONFORMANCE_MATRIX entries:
- SCPSC-ENV-001, SCPSC-ENV-002, SCPSC-ENV-003
