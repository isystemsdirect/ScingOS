---

## Overview

ScingOS is a voice-first, touchless operating layer where **Scing** is the primary face and voice, coordinating context, memory, tools, and workflows across all devices through the **SCINGULAR AI** platform. Rather than behaving like a traditional desktop OS, ScingOS functions as a **Scing-centric gateway**—users speak to Scing, and Scing orchestrates everything else.

ScingOS is the **body** to SCINGULAR AI's **brain**, connecting users to powerful cloud-based intelligence through the proprietary **AIP (Augmented Intelligence Portal) protocol**.

---

## Mission and Vision

**Empower inspectors, property owners, and regulatory agencies** with instant access to up-to-date compliance standards, actionable insights, and workflow automation. ScingOS is engineered to expand seamlessly as user and data needs grow, from secure cloud deployments to dedicated server infrastructure.

### Core Philosophy: Bona Fide Intelligence (BFI)

At the heart of ScingOS is the philosophy of **Bona Fide Intelligence**. In this ecosystem:

- **AI = Augmented Intelligence**, not Artificial Intelligence
- The goal is to **genuinely augment human capability** with transparent, trustworthy systems
- Intelligence amplifies perception, decision-making, and connection while **preserving human agency**
- Systems are authentic, human-serving, and transparent by design

---

## Technology Highlights

### Architecture

#### 🧠 **LARI** - Language and Reasoning Intelligence Engines
- Perception and analysis engines
- Standards lookup and code intelligence
- Multi-jurisdictional compliance verification
- Inspection workflow automation

#### 🛡️ **BANE** - Backend Augmented Neural Engine (Security Governor)
- Zero-trust security framework
- Capability-based authorization
- Immutable audit trails (Security Decision Records)
- Threat detection and isolation ("demon mode")

#### 🔗 **AIP Protocol** - Augmented Intelligence Portal
- Real-time communication between client and cloud
- Secure, authenticated data channels
- Task orchestration and result delivery

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js / React
- **Backend**: Firebase (Authentication, Firestore, Cloud Functions, Storage)
- **AI Platform**: SCINGULAR AI cloud services
- **Security**: BANE governance layer with cryptographic verification
- **Protocol**: AIP (proprietary real-time protocol)

## Key Capabilities

- ✅ **Single conversational gateway** to SCINGULAR AI tools and agents
- ✅ **Contextual memory** that persists across sessions under user control
- ✅ **Real-time status and logs** showing what the system is doing
- ✅ **Domain-specific workflows** (inspection, compliance, operations)
- ✅ **Multi-jurisdictional code intelligence** with semantic AI search
- ✅ **Interactive dashboards** with sentiment analysis and automated reporting
- ✅ **Device integration** for cameras, LiDAR, drones, and inspection equipment
- ✅ **Verifiable authenticity** through cryptographically signed reports

## Getting Started

### For Users

1. Access a ScingOS surface (web client bound to your SCINGULAR AI project)
2. Sign in with your organization account via Firebase Authentication
3. Wake Scing: **"Hey, Scing!"**
4. State your intent (e.g., "Start a new inspection session")
5. Follow Scing's prompts as it assembles context, agents, and tools

### For Developers

1. Clone this repository
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/isystemsdirect/ScingOS.git
   cd ScingOS
   ```

2. Review architecture documentation
   - See `/docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` for system design
   - See `/docs/AIP-PROTOCOL.md` for protocol specification

3. Configure Firebase and SCINGULAR AI credentials
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your credentials
   ```

4. Run the ScingOS client locally
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

5. Inspect AIP traffic, logs, and workflows in the developer console

## Security & Governance

ScingOS implements a **zero-trust security model** through BANE:

- **Capability-based authorization** - no action without explicit permission
- **Immutable audit trails** - every privileged action is logged and signed
- **Data minimization** - components access only the minimum data required
- **Threat isolation** - suspicious behavior triggers immediate containment
- **Cryptographic verification** - reports and decisions are provably authentic

See `/docs/BANE-SECURITY.md` for complete security architecture.
