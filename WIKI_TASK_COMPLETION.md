## Recommendations for Completion

### Priority Order for Remaining Documentation

**Week 1-2 Focus** (Critical for Phase 1 Alpha):
1. AIP-Protocol.md - Needed for client-server communication implementation
2. SCING-Interface.md - Needed for voice interface development
3. LARI-Engines.md - Needed for AI engine integration
4. BANE-Security.md - Needed for security implementation

**Week 3-4 Focus** (Important for development):
5. Development-Guide.md - Enable external contributions
6. Firebase-Integration.md - Backend integration reference
7. Deployment.md - Production deployment procedures

**Week 5-6 Focus** (Completion):
8. API-Reference.md - Complete technical reference
9. Hardware-Adapters.md - Device integration guide
10. Neural-3D-Environment.md - 3D interface details
11. Legal-Framework.md - Legal and compliance

### Resource Allocation

**Estimated Effort per Document**:
- **Large (5000+ words)**: 6-8 hours research + writing + review
- **Medium (4000 words)**: 5-6 hours research + writing + review  
- **Small (3000 words)**: 3-4 hours research + writing + review

**Total Remaining Effort**: ~55-70 hours

**Suggested Approach**:
- Assign 1-2 documents per week per technical writer
- Technical SME review for accuracy
- Community contributions welcome for specific sections

### Quality Assurance

Before considering each document complete:
- [ ] Meets minimum word count requirement
- [ ] Comprehensive table of contents
- [ ] Code examples tested and functional
- [ ] Diagrams clear and accurate
- [ ] Cross-references verified
- [ ] Formatted with Prettier
- [ ] Technical review completed
- [ ] User testing for clarity (where applicable)
