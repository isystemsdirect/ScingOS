## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: HSL(52, 80%, 45%) which translates to a deep gold (#B8860B). Gold invokes professionalism, trustworthiness, and quality, while avoiding cliches related to safety, construction or finance.
- Background color: HSL(50, 20%, 87%) which translates to a light tan (#E6E2D4). It offers a professional-looking and non-stark background in light mode.
- Accent color: HSL(22, 70%, 40%) which translates to a muted rusty orange (#B35A0D). It provides visual contrast, especially for call-to-action elements.
- Body and headline font: 'Alegreya', a serif font which is elegant, intellectual, and contemporary.
- Use clear and professional icons that are related to inspections and construction.
- A clean, organized layout that supports a seamless inspection workflow.
- Subtle animations that support the user flow without being distracting.
