## Logo Animation

### Boot Screen Animation

**Concept:**
The orange (or neon green) accent dot rotates clockwise around the navy circle, completing one full rotation as the system initializes.

**Timing:**
- Duration: 2-3 seconds
- Easing: ease-in-out
- Loop: continuous until boot complete

**Sequence:**
1. Logo fades in (0.5s)
2. Orange dot begins rotation (1.5-2s)
3. "SCINGULAR OS" text fades in below (0.5s)
4. "Powered by Scing" fades in (0.3s)
5. On boot complete: dot stops at top, gentle pulse

**Neon Green Variant:**
For dark mode or night boot sequences, use neon green (#00FF88) accent with glow effect:
- Outer glow: 8px blur, 40% opacity
- Inner glow: 4px blur, 60% opacity
- Creates futuristic, tech-forward aesthetic

### UI Element Animation

**Active State:**
- Pulsing glow effect on accent dot
- 1.5s cycle, ease-in-out
- Expands from 100% to 120% and back

**Loading State:**
- Rotating accent around circle
- Continuous smooth rotation
- Optional: leave trail effect
