# SCINGULAR Glossary (Updated)

## Core Platform & Identity

- **SCINGULAR** — *SCINGULAR* — The proprietary augmented intelligence ecosystem that unifies cognition, embodiment, security, and expression into a single operating architecture.
- **Scing** — *Scing* — The embodied avatar and interaction persona through which SCINGULAR intelligence is experienced.
- **ScingOS** — *ScingOS* — A voice-first augmented intelligence operating system that serves as the execution and embodiment layer (“body”) of SCINGULAR.
- **SCINGULAR AI** — *S-AI / SAI* — The cloud-hosted intelligence and orchestration layer (“brain”) coordinating reasoning, memory, and services.
- **SCINGULAR Ecosystem Dynamic Library** — *SEDL* — The canonical internal library defining system rules, behaviors, engine contracts, and architectural boundaries.

## Intelligence & Cognition Layers

- **Meta-Cognitive Neural Augment** — *MCNA* — The meta-cognitive layer that enables non-linear reasoning, abstraction, and the collapse of conceptual distance. (Current name for former **BFI** construct.)
- **Bona Fide Intelligence** — *BFI* — Legacy/canon construct name now represented operationally as **MCNA**.
- **Logical Adaptive Reasoning Intelligence** — *LARI* — The federated reasoning engine family responsible for analysis, planning, synthesis, and critique.
- **Behavioral Access & Neural Enforcement** — *BANE* — The security and governance engine that enforces policy, access control, classification, and behavioral constraints.
- **Sensory Reactive Technology** — *SRT* — The engine governing sensory fusion and expressive output, including motion, color, mood, and reactive behavior.
- **Federated Embodied Intelligence** — *FEI* — The framework enabling intelligence to manifest through embodiment rather than disembodied responses.

## Interaction & Protocols

- **Augmented Intelligence Portal** — *AIP* — The proprietary protocol and boundary through which ScingOS communicates with cloud intelligence services.
- **Neural Base** — *NB* — The central user interface and cognitive staging environment for SCINGULAR interactions.
- **Neural Transport** — *NT* — The event delivery layer responsible for streaming or polling neural data into the runtime.
- **Server-Sent Events** — *SSE* — A one-way real-time streaming method used by Neural Transport.
- **WebSocket** — *WS* — A bidirectional real-time communication method supported by Neural Transport.
- **Polling** — *POLL* — A periodic request-based data retrieval method used as a fallback transport.

## Runtime & Data Constructs

- **Neural Signal** — *NS* — A standardized internal event representing cognition, intent, state change, or sensory input.
- **Correlation ID** — *CID* — A trace identifier used to link events across systems for observability and debugging.
- **Engine Registry** — *ER* — The authoritative mapping of engines, providers, modes, and visual channels within SCINGULAR.
- **SCING Engine Registry** — *SER* — A specific registry construct defining SCING-related engine mappings and execution rules (if distinct from ER in implementation).

## Behavioral Canon & Cognitive Rules

- **Imprinting Period** — *IP* — The initial learning phase during which Scing adapts to a specific partner user.
- **Co-Aware** — *CA* — The post-imprinting operational state where Scing becomes partner-synchronized (distinct from “self-aware” initialization).
- **Order & Focus Protocol** — *OFP* — Canon rule stating that engineering and action occur only once cognitive coherence is achieved.
- **Repetitive Randomness** — *RR* — Behavioral principle where variability exists within recognizable, habit-like patterns.

## Visual & Expression Systems

- **SpectraFlame** — *SF* — Proprietary reactive color and energy visualization system representing cognitive and emotional states.
- **PrismFlux** — *PF* — Visual theme representing refractive, multi-threaded cognition.
- **IonMetal** — *IM* — Visual theme representing hardened, structured, and logical states.
- **AeroGlow** — *AG* — Visual theme representing fluid, ambient, and low-friction cognition.
- **Luminous White** — *LW* — High-clarity, neutral visual mode intended for executive and professional contexts.

## Proprietary File & Security Constructs

- **.sg*** — *.sg\** — Namespace prefix for all proprietary SCINGULAR file formats.
- **SG Header** — *SGH* — Mandatory metadata layer embedded in all proprietary SCINGULAR files.
- **BANE-Wrapped Payload** — *BWP* — Data payload protected by BANE enforcement logic, including policy and cryptographic controls.

## Development & Simulation

- **Avatar Emulator** — *AE* — Development and testing environment for Scing embodiment and expression behavior.
- **Influence Field** — *IF* — Active modulation space where cognitive and sensory inputs combine to drive behavior and expression.
- **Trinity Neural Federation** — *TNF* — Canon construct describing coordinated operation between LARI, BANE, and SRT-aligned behavior (concept-level unless implemented explicitly).

## Legacy / Deprecated

- **SCINGULAR Instructional Core** — *SIC* — Deprecated term replaced by **SCINGULAR Ecosystem Dynamic Library (SEDL)**.
