# ICB-23 — VALIDATION, VERIFICATION & CLAIM SUBSTANTIATION FRAMEWORK

**STATUS:** CANONICAL / INHERITS ICB-01 THROUGH ICB-22 / NON-OPTIONAL

---

## 1. PURPOSE

ICB-23 defines how SCINGULAR:

- Validates its own operation
- Verifies inspection outcomes
- Substantiates software claims
- Demonstrates regulatory fitness
- Supports legal, investor, and authority scrutiny

This block is the proof engine of the platform.

---

## 2. CLAIM CLASSES (CANONICAL)

SCINGULAR claims SHALL be classified as:

- Functional claims (what the system does)
- Compliance claims (laws, codes, standards)
- Accuracy claims (inspection findings)
- Reliability claims (uptime, resilience)
- Integrity claims (data, evidence, reports)

Each claim class requires evidence.

---

## 3. VALIDATION VS VERIFICATION

**Validation:**

- Confirms the system is built correctly
- Tests logic, workflows, and controls
- Confirms conformance to codex (ICBs)

**Verification:**

- Confirms inspections were executed correctly
- Confirms outputs reflect observed reality
- Confirms authority alignment

Both are required.

---

## 4. SYSTEM VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS

SCINGULAR SHALL:

- Validate ICB inheritance and enforcement
- Test jurisdiction resolution logic
- Test lifecycle enforcement
- Test authorization and scope controls
- Test failure and recovery behavior

Validation results SHALL be versioned.

---

## 5. INSPECTION VERIFICATION MECHANISMS

Verification may include:

- Supervisor review
- Authority review
- Re-inspection sampling
- Evidence cross-checking
- Automated consistency checks

Critical findings require secondary review.

---

## 6. CLAIM SUBSTANTIATION ARTIFACTS

SCINGULAR SHALL produce artifacts including:

- Test reports
- Validation logs
- Audit records
- Performance metrics
- Traceability matrices
- Governance approvals

Artifacts SHALL be preserved and accessible.

---

## 7. CHANGE IMPACT VALIDATION

When system or codex changes occur:

- Affected claims SHALL be revalidated
- Regression risks SHALL be assessed
- Prior claim substantiation SHALL remain intact

---

## 10. SYSTEM ENFORCEMENT
