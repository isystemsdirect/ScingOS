## Core Philosophy: Bona Fide Intelligence (BFI)

At the heart of ScingOS is **Bona Fide Intelligence**:

- **AI = Augmented Intelligence**, not Artificial Intelligence
- Systems **genuinely augment human capability** with transparent, trustworthy technology
- Intelligence amplifies perception and decision-making while **preserving human agency**
- All systems are authentic, human-serving, and transparent by design
