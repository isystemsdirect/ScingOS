# ICB-24 — CODEX CLOSURE, SYSTEM CERTIFICATION & OPERATIONAL ATTESTATION

**STATUS:** FINAL / CANONICAL / INHERITS ICB-01 THROUGH ICB-23 / NON-OPTIONAL

---

## 1. PURPOSE

ICB-24 formally:

- Closes the SCINGULAR Inspection Codex
- Certifies internal completeness and consistency
- Establishes operational attestation
- Defines reliance, usage, and trust boundaries
- Declares the system inspection-ready, audit-ready, and defensible

This block is the ratification and seal of the codex.

---

## 2. CODEX COMPLETENESS DECLARATION

The SCINGULAR Inspection Codex (ICB-01 through ICB-24):

- Fully defines inspection logic, authority, and execution
- Covers legal, regulatory, operational, and ethical dimensions
- Enforces lifecycle, evidence, enforcement, and governance controls
- Addresses failure, recovery, audit, and validation requirements

No required inspection function remains undefined.

---

## 3. INTERNAL CONSISTENCY ATTESTATION

SCINGULAR hereby attests that:

- All ICBs are hierarchically consistent
- Inheritance relationships are explicit and enforced
- No ICB contradicts a higher-order ICB
- Conflicts are resolved by defined precedence rules

Internal inconsistency SHALL constitute a system defect.

---

## 4. OPERATIONAL CERTIFICATION STATEMENT

When deployed in conformance with this codex, SCINGULAR may be represented as:

- Jurisdiction-aware
- Authority-aligned
- Inspection-scope enforced
- Evidence-defensible
- Audit-ready
- Legally constrained
- Human-accountable

Any representation beyond this scope is prohibited.

---

## 5. RELIANCE & LIMITATION OF USE

SCINGULAR outputs may be relied upon for:

- Regulatory inspection support
- Compliance verification
- Risk assessment
- Audit and oversight
- Decision support

SCINGULAR outputs SHALL NOT be relied upon for:

- Engineering design certification
- Legal judgment or legal advice
- Guarantee of future performance
- Replacement of statutory authority

---

## 6. CERTIFICATION CONDITIONS

Certification is valid only when:

- All applicable ICBs are active
- Jurisdiction resolution is successful
- Inspector credentials are valid
- Evidence rules are enforced
- Reports are issued without tampering

Failure of any condition invalidates certification for the affected inspection.

---

## 7. CHANGE & RE-CERTIFICATION REQUIREMENTS

Any change to:

- An ICB
- Core inspection logic
- Authority resolution rules
- Evidence handling
- Enforcement mechanisms

SHALL require:

- Impact assessment
- Re-validation (ICB-23)
- Re-certification under this block

---

## 8. EXTERNAL REPRESENTATION RULES

All external communication SHALL:

- Accurately reflect certified capabilities
- Reference governing authorities where applicable
- Avoid overstated or absolute claims
- Preserve attribution and provenance

Misrepresentation constitutes a governance violation.

---

## 9. CODEX SEAL & EFFECTIVE STATUS

Upon activation of ICB-24:

- The Inspection Codex is complete
- The system is operationally ratified
- All inspections are bound to this codex
- Historical inspections remain bound to prior versions

This block SHALL remain final unless superseded by formal governance action.

---

## 10. FINAL DECLARATION

The SCINGULAR Inspection Codex is hereby:
