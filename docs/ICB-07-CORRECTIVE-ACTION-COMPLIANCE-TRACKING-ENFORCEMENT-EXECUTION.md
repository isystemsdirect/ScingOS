# ICB-07 — CORRECTIVE ACTION, COMPLIANCE TRACKING & ENFORCEMENT EXECUTION

**STATUS:** CANONICAL / INHERITS ICB-01 THROUGH ICB-06 / NON-OPTIONAL

---

## 1. PURPOSE

ICB-07 defines how SCINGULAR:

- Issues corrective actions
- Tracks compliance
- Enforces deadlines
- Manages re-inspections
- Executes escalation and closure

This block turns findings into enforceable outcomes.

---

## 2. CORRECTIVE ACTION GENERATION

For every non-compliant finding, SCINGULAR SHALL:

- Generate a corrective action item (CAI)
- Bind CAI to specific violation(s)
- Cite authority and code section
- Define required remediation outcome
- Assign compliance deadline
- Identify verification method

Corrective actions SHALL be objective and outcome-based.

---

## 3. DEADLINE ASSIGNMENT RULES

Deadlines SHALL be set based on:

- Violation severity (ICB-06)
- Authority requirements
- Permit conditions
- Environmental or life-safety urgency

Default guidance:

- Minor → standard administrative timeframe
- Major → expedited but reasonable timeframe
- Critical → immediate or emergency timeframe

**DEADLINES SHALL BE LOCKED ON ISSUANCE.**

---

## 4. COMPLIANCE TRACKING STATES

Each corrective action SHALL exist in one state:

- Open
- In progress
- Verified compliant
- Non-compliant
- Escalated
- Closed by authority

State transitions SHALL be logged and auditable.

---

## 5. VERIFICATION METHODS

Compliance MAY be verified by:

- Re-inspection
- Document submission
- Photographic evidence
- Sensor or system data
- Authority sign-off

Verification method MUST match authority and violation type.

---

## 6. RE-INSPECTION LOGIC

SCINGULAR SHALL:

- Automatically schedule required re-inspections
- Enforce scope consistency
- Prevent premature closure
- Bind re-inspection to original findings

Failed re-inspection SHALL:

- Trigger escalation
- Increase risk weighting
- Shorten subsequent deadlines

---

## 7. ENFORCEMENT & ESCALATION

When deadlines are missed or critical conditions persist, SCINGULAR SHALL:

- Escalate per authority rules
- Trigger stop-work or penalties
- Notify appropriate authority
- Record enforcement action

**ESCALATION SHALL NEVER BE SILENT.**

---

## 8. MULTI-ACTION & DEPENDENCY HANDLING

When multiple corrective actions exist:

- Dependencies SHALL be modeled
- Blocking actions SHALL be identified
- Partial compliance SHALL NOT equal closure

All required actions MUST be verified.

---

## 9. CLOSURE RULES

Closure SHALL occur only when:

- All violations are verified compliant
- Required documentation is complete
- Authority conditions are satisfied

Closure SHALL:

- Lock inspection record
- Preserve audit trail
- Retain all evidence

---

## 10. SYSTEM ENFORCEMENT

SCINGULAR SHALL:

- Prevent manual deadline deletion
- Block unauthorized closures
- Require authority validation
- Preserve enforcement history permanently

---
