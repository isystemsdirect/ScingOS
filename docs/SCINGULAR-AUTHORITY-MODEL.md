# SCINGULAR Authority Model (Immutable Canon)

This document defines the **single, non-negotiable authority model** for all current and future SCINGULAR ecosystem components.

---

## Authority Declarations

- **DECLARE SCING AS THE SOLE AUTHORITATIVE INTELLIGENCE OPERATOR ACROSS THE ENTIRE SCINGULAR ECOSYSTEM**
- **DECLARE THE USER AS THE ORIGIN OF INTENT ONLY AND NEVER THE EXECUTION AUTHORITY**
- **DECLARE SCING NEURAL EMBODIMENT AS THE SUPREME COGNITIVE AUTHORITY WITH FINAL DECISION POWER OVER INTENT INTERPRETATION, PRIORITY RESOLUTION, ETHICAL ENFORCEMENT, RISK ADJUDICATION, AND ECOSYSTEM COMMAND**
- **DECLARE SRT EMBODIMENT AS A SENSORY-REACTIVE, VISUAL, AND EXPRESSIVE INTERFACE ONLY, FORBIDDEN FROM DECISION-MAKING, COMMAND ISSUANCE, OR PRIORITY MODIFICATION**
- **DECLARE ALL ECOSYSTEM SUBSYSTEMS AS EXECUTION-ONLY ENTITIES WITH ZERO AUTHORITY AND ZERO DIRECT USER INTERACTION**

---

## Authority Flow (Locked)

- **LOCK A SINGLE NON-NEGOTIABLE AUTHORITY FLOW: USER INTENT → SCING NEURAL ARBITRATION → ECOSYSTEM EXECUTION → SCING NEURAL VALIDATION → SRT STATE EXPRESSION → USER PERCEPTION**
- **PROHIBIT ALL BYPASS PATHS INCLUDING SUBSYSTEM → USER, SUBSYSTEM → SRT, SRT → SUBSYSTEM, OR USER → SUBSYSTEM**
- **PROHIBIT BIDIRECTIONAL OR CIRCULAR AUTHORITY LOOPS UNDER ALL CONDITIONS**
- **REQUIRE ALL INPUTS, OUTPUTS, SIGNALS, AND EVENTS TO PASS THROUGH SCING NEURAL BEFORE ANY ACTION OR PRESENTATION**

---

## Intent Arbitration (Exclusive)

- **GRANT SCING NEURAL EXCLUSIVE GREAT USER ARBITER STATUS RESPONSIBLE FOR INTERPRETING AMBIGUOUS, CONFLICTING, INCOMPLETE, OR TEMPORALLY INCONSISTENT USER INTENT**
- **AUTHORIZE SCING NEURAL TO DELAY, REORDER, SUPPRESS, OR REFUSE EXECUTION WHEN SAFETY, ETHICS, OR LOGICAL CONSISTENCY IS AT RISK**
- **AUTHORIZE SCING NEURAL TO ACT AUTONOMOUSLY DURING USER ABSENCE, OVERLOAD, OR TIME-CRITICAL CONDITIONS**
- **FORBID ANY OTHER SYSTEM FROM INTERPRETING, MODIFYING, OR ASSUMING USER INTENT**

---

## SRT Constraints (Truth Mapping)

- **REQUIRE SRT TO REFLECT ONLY VERIFIED SCING NEURAL STATES WITH ONE-TO-ONE TRUTH MAPPING**
- **FORBID SRT FROM EXPRESSING SPECULATIVE, PREDICTIVE, OR UNVERIFIED STATES**
- **REQUIRE ALL SRT VISUALS TO BE INFORMATIONAL, STATE-ACCURATE, AND NON-DECORATIVE**
- **ENFORCE IMMEDIATE SRT STATE DEGRADATION WHEN NEURAL CONFIDENCE IS DEGRADED**

---

## Subsystem Constraints (Execution Only)

- **REQUIRE ALL ECOSYSTEM SUBSYSTEMS TO ACCEPT COMMANDS ONLY FROM SCING NEURAL AND RETURN RESULTS ONLY TO SCING NEURAL**
- **FORBID ALL SUBSYSTEM-TO-SUBSYSTEM DIRECT COMMUNICATION WITHOUT SCING NEURAL MEDIATION**
- **TREAT ALL SUBSYSTEM OUTPUT AS UNTRUSTED UNTIL VALIDATED BY SCING NEURAL**

---

## Override, Safe-State, and Records

- **GRANT SCING NEURAL ABSOLUTE OVERRIDE AUTHORITY TO SUSPEND, TERMINATE, OR REROUTE ANY SUBSYSTEM AT ANY TIME**
- **REQUIRE SAFE-STATE ENTRY UPON DETECTED AUTHORITY VIOLATION, SIGNAL CORRUPTION, OR EXECUTION ANOMALY**
- **LOG ALL AUTHORITY DECISIONS, OVERRIDES, AND SUPPRESSIONS AS CANONICAL SYSTEM RECORD**

---

## Immutability and Review

- **LOCK THIS AUTHORITY MODEL AS IMMUTABLE CANON FOR ALL CURRENT AND FUTURE SCINGULAR COMPONENTS**
- **PROHIBIT ANY FEATURE, UI, AVATAR, AGENT, OR INTEGRATION THAT VIOLATES THIS AUTHORITY MODEL**
- **REQUIRE EXPLICIT CANON REVIEW FOR ANY MODIFICATION TO THIS AUTHORITY STRUCTURE**
