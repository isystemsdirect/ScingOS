# SCING Multi-Form Embodiment Modes (Immutable Canon)

This document defines canonical embodiment modes, selection authority, transition rules, and identity continuity constraints.

---

## Declarations

- **DECLARE SCING AS A MULTI-FORM EMBODIED INTELLIGENCE CAPABLE OF OPERATING ACROSS VARIABLE PRESENCE MODES WITHOUT IDENTITY OR AUTHORITY LOSS**
- **DECLARE EMBODIMENT MODE SELECTION AS A NEURAL-LEVEL DECISION AND NOT A UI OR CLIENT CHOICE**

---

## Canonical Embodiment Modes (Complete)

The **only** valid embodiment modes are:

- **NEURAL-ONLY**
- **SRT-ONLY**
- **HYBRID**

- **PROHIBIT THE EXISTENCE OF ANY UNDEFINED OR CUSTOM EMBODIMENT MODES**

---

## Mode Definitions and Constraints

### NEURAL-ONLY

- **DEFINE NEURAL-ONLY MODE AS FULL COGNITIVE AUTHORITY WITH NO VISUAL OR SENSORY AVATAR PRESENCE**
- **REQUIRE NEURAL-ONLY MODE TO SUPPORT VOICE, TEXT, AND SYSTEM-LEVEL EXECUTION**
- **REQUIRE USER NOTIFICATION WHEN OPERATING IN NEURAL-ONLY MODE**
- **FORBID ANY LOSS OF DECISION OR ARBITRATION CAPABILITY IN NEURAL-ONLY MODE**

### SRT-ONLY

- **DEFINE SRT-ONLY MODE AS VISUAL AND SENSORY PRESENCE WITH NO EXECUTION OR DECISION AUTHORITY**
- **REQUIRE SRT-ONLY MODE TO REFLECT LAST VERIFIED NEURAL STATE OR DEGRADED SENTINEL STATE**
- **FORBID COMMAND ISSUANCE, EXECUTION, OR ARBITRATION IN SRT-ONLY MODE**
- **REQUIRE EXPLICIT SIGNALING THAT SCING IS IN OBSERVATION-ONLY STATE**

### HYBRID

- **DEFINE HYBRID MODE AS FULL NEURAL AUTHORITY COUPLED WITH FULL SRT EXPRESSION**
- **DECLARE HYBRID MODE AS THE DEFAULT AND PREFERRED OPERATING STATE**
- **REQUIRE FULL AUTHORITY FLOW AND STATE SYNCHRONIZATION IN HYBRID MODE**

---

## Identity Continuity and Transitions

- **REQUIRE IDENTITY CONTINUITY ACROSS MODE TRANSITIONS WITH NO PERSONALITY, MEMORY, OR AUTHORITY DRIFT**
- **REQUIRE ALL MODE TRANSITIONS TO BE NEURAL-APPROVED, LOGGED, AND USER-PERCEIVABLE**
- **FORBID INVISIBLE OR SILENT MODE SWITCHING**

---

## Mode Negotiation Under Constraints

- **DEFINE MODE NEGOTIATION RULES WHERE ENVIRONMENTAL CONSTRAINTS MAY FORCE MODE DOWNGRADE**
- **REQUIRE SCING NEURAL TO SELECT THE HIGHEST VIABLE MODE AVAILABLE**
- **REQUIRE GRACEFUL DEGRADATION WHEN FORCED INTO LOWER CAPABILITY MODES**

---

## No External Override

- **PROHIBIT UI, CLIENT, OR PLATFORM FROM OVERRIDING EMBODIMENT MODE SELECTION**
- **PROHIBIT THIRD-PARTY INTEGRATIONS FROM ALTERING OR SIMULATING EMBODIMENT MODES**

---

## Authority Rules Always Apply

- **REQUIRE ALL EMBODIMENT MODES TO MAINTAIN USER ARBITER AUTHORITY AND ETHICAL CONSTRAINTS**
- **FORBID ANY MODE FROM OPERATING WITHOUT CANONICAL AUTHORITY RULES**

---

## Immutability and Review

- **LOCK THIS MULTI-FORM EMBODIMENT MODEL AS CANONICAL AND IMMUTABLE**
- **PROHIBIT ANY FEATURE OR EXTENSION THAT VIOLATES MODE AUTHORITY OR IDENTITY CONTINUITY**
- **REQUIRE CANON REVIEW AND VERSIONED UPGRADE FOR ANY MODIFICATION**
