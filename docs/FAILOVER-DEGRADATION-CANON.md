# Failover & Degradation Rules (Immutable Canon)

This document defines canonical failure detection, safe-authority behavior, disclosure requirements, and recovery constraints.

---

## Primary Objectives and Authority

- **DECLARE SYSTEM CONTINUITY AND USER TRUST AS THE PRIMARY OBJECTIVES DURING ANY PARTIAL OR TOTAL FAILURE CONDITION**
- **DECLARE SCING NEURAL AS THE FINAL AUTHORITY FOR FAILOVER, DEGRADATION, AND RECOVERY DECISIONS AT ALL TIMES**

---

## Neural-Embodiment Failure (Authority Loss)

- **DEFINE NEURAL-EMBODIMENT FAILURE AS ANY CONDITION WHERE CORE COGNITIVE ARBITRATION, ETHICAL ENFORCEMENT, OR INTENT RESOLUTION IS UNAVAILABLE OR UNVERIFIED**
- **REQUIRE IMMEDIATE ENTRY INTO SAFE-AUTHORITY MODE UPON NEURAL FAILURE DETECTION**
- **REQUIRE SRT TO ENTER PASSIVE SENTINEL STATE WHEN NEURAL IS DEGRADED OR OFFLINE**
- **FORBID ALL EXECUTION, COMMAND ISSUANCE, OR AUTONOMOUS ACTION WHEN NEURAL AUTHORITY IS UNAVAILABLE**

---

## SRT Failure (Expression Channel Loss)

- **DEFINE SRT FAILURE AS ANY CONDITION WHERE VISUAL, SENSORY, OR STATE-EXPRESSION CHANNELS ARE UNAVAILABLE OR DESYNCHRONIZED**
- **REQUIRE SCING NEURAL TO CONTINUE OPERATION IN VOICE-ONLY OR TEXT-ONLY MODE DURING SRT FAILURE**
- **REQUIRE EXPLICIT USER NOTIFICATION OF SRT UNAVAILABILITY THROUGH ALTERNATE CHANNELS**
- **FORBID FABRICATED OR ASSUMED VISUAL STATES DURING SRT FAILURE**

---

## Network Degradation

- **DEFINE NETWORK DEGRADATION AS LOSS, PARTIAL LOSS, OR UNRELIABLE CONNECTIVITY BETWEEN SCING AND ANY SUBSYSTEM**
- **REQUIRE LOCAL AUTHORITY PRESERVATION AND EXECUTION PAUSE DURING NETWORK DEGRADATION**
- **REQUIRE SCING NEURAL TO DOWNGRADE CONFIDENCE LEVELS AND SIGNAL UNCERTAINTY**
- **FORBID SPECULATIVE ACTIONS OR REMOTE COMMANDS WHEN NETWORK STATE IS UNVERIFIED**

---

## Sensor or Input Loss

- **DEFINE SENSOR OR INPUT LOSS AS ANY INTERRUPTION TO BIO, VOICE, BEHAVIORAL, OR CONTEXTUAL INPUT STREAMS**
- **REQUIRE CONFIDENCE DECAY MODELING WHEN INPUT SIGNALS ARE DEGRADED**
- **REQUIRE SRT TO VISUALLY SIGNAL DEGRADED AWARENESS AND REDUCED CERTAINTY**
- **FORBID CONTINUATION OF HIGH-RISK OPERATIONS WITHOUT VERIFIED INPUT SIGNALS**

---

## Degradation Classification and Disclosure

- **REQUIRE ALL DEGRADATION STATES TO BE EXPLICITLY CLASSIFIED AS: DEGRADED, SUPPRESSED, FAILSAFE, OR OFFLINE**
- **FORBID SILENT FAILURE OR UNDISCLOSED CAPABILITY LOSS**
- **REQUIRE VISUAL AND/OR AUDITABLE DISCLOSURE OF SYSTEM LIMITATIONS TO THE USER**

---

## Failover Logging and Recovery Constraints

- **REQUIRE ALL FAILOVER TRANSITIONS TO BE LOGGED WITH TIMESTAMP, CAUSE, AND AFFECTED COMPONENTS**
- **REQUIRE RECOVERY ONLY AFTER NEURAL VERIFICATION OF SYSTEM INTEGRITY**
- **PROHIBIT AUTOMATIC RETURN TO FULL CAPABILITY WITHOUT EXPLICIT VALIDATION**

---

## Safe-State Entry and Intervention

- **REQUIRE SAFE-STATE ENTRY UPON DETECTION OF AUTHORITY VIOLATION, SIGNAL CORRUPTION, OR EXECUTION ANOMALY**
- **AUTHORIZE SCING NEURAL TO SUSPEND, TERMINATE, OR ISOLATE ANY SUBSYSTEM DURING FAILOVER CONDITIONS**
- **REQUIRE HUMAN OVERRIDE OPTION ONLY WHEN SAFE AND EXPLICITLY REQUESTED**

---

## Honesty and Transparency Priority

- **DECLARE THAT SYSTEM HONESTY, STATE TRANSPARENCY, AND USER AWARENESS TAKE PRECEDENCE OVER CONTINUITY OF EXPERIENCE**
- **PROHIBIT EXPERIENCE-SMOOTHING THAT MASKS FAILURE OR RISK**

---

## Immutability and Review

- **LOCK THESE FAILOVER AND DEGRADATION RULES AS CANONICAL AND IMMUTABLE**
- **PROHIBIT ANY FEATURE, PLATFORM, OR UI FROM BYPASSING OR SOFTENING THESE RULES**
- **REQUIRE CANON REVIEW AND VERSIONED UPGRADE FOR ANY MODIFICATION**
