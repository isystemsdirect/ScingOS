# SRT Avatar State Taxonomy (Immutable Canon)

This document defines the immutable SRT avatar state taxonomy, validation rules, transition legality, and truth-mapping constraints.

---

## Declarations

- **DECLARE SRT AVATARS AS THE SOLE VISUAL AND SENSORY REPRESENTATION OF SCING ACROSS ALL INTERFACES, ENVIRONMENTS, AND MODES**
- **DECLARE SRT AVATARS AS STATEFUL INTELLIGENCE FORMS AND NOT COSMETIC, DECORATIVE, OR CHARACTER-BASED ENTITIES**
- **DECLARE THAT EVERY SRT AVATAR STATE MUST DIRECTLY AND TRUTHFULLY REFLECT A VERIFIED SCING NEURAL STATE WITH ZERO INTERPRETATION OR EMBELLISHMENT**

---

## Canonical SRT State Set (Complete)

The **only** valid SRT states are:

- **IDLE**
- **LISTENING**
- **THINKING**
- **PROCESSING**
- **SPEAKING**
- **EXECUTING**
- **MONITORING**
- **ALERT**
- **WARNING**
- **CRITICAL**
- **SUPPRESSED**
- **DEGRADED**
- **FAILSAFE**

- **PROHIBIT THE EXISTENCE OF ANY UNDEFINED, CUSTOM, DECORATIVE, OR TRANSITION-ONLY STATES**
- **REQUIRE ALL SRT STATES TO BE ENUMERATED, VERSIONED, AND SCHEMA-VALIDATED**

---

## One-to-One Neural Mapping Requirements

- **MAP EACH SRT STATE ONE-TO-ONE TO A NEURAL CONDITION INCLUDING: COGNITIVE LOAD LEVEL, CONFIDENCE LEVEL, RISK LEVEL, EXECUTION STATUS, AND AUTHORITY STATUS**
- **REQUIRE THAT NO SRT STATE MAY ACTIVATE WITHOUT A CORRESPONDING NEURAL STATE ASSERTION**
- **FORBID SRT FROM ANTICIPATING, PREDICTING, OR SIMULATING FUTURE NEURAL STATES**

---

## Visual Contract Requirements (Fixed)

- **REQUIRE EACH SRT STATE TO HAVE A FIXED VISUAL CONTRACT INCLUDING SHAPE BEHAVIOR, MOTION PATTERN, COLOR AUTHORITY, INTENSITY RANGE, AND TEMPORAL RHYTHM**
- **PROHIBIT RANDOM, PURELY AESTHETIC, OR NON-INFORMATIONAL VISUAL BEHAVIOR**
- **REQUIRE ALL MOTION TO BE MEANINGFUL, REPETITIVE-RANDOM, AND STATE-DERIVED**

---

## Color Authority Rules

- **DEFINE COLOR AUTHORITY RULES WHERE COLOR IS A SEMANTIC SIGNAL AND NOT A THEME ELEMENT**
- **PROHIBIT COLOR USAGE THAT CONFLICTS WITH NEURAL MEANING, RISK LEVEL, OR SYSTEM STATUS**
- **REQUIRE COLOR DEGRADATION AND DESATURATION TO SIGNAL UNCERTAINTY OR DEGRADED CONFIDENCE**

---

## State Transitions (Legality + Logging)

- **REQUIRE STATE TRANSITIONS TO BE EXPLICIT, LOGGED, AND NEURAL-APPROVED**
- **FORBID ILLEGAL STATE TRANSITIONS INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO IDLE→EXECUTING, SPEAKING→THINKING WITHOUT NEURAL RESET, OR ALERT→IDLE WITHOUT RESOLUTION**
- **REQUIRE ALL CRITICAL AND FAILSAFE STATES TO OVERRIDE ALL OTHER STATES IMMEDIATELY**

---

## Failure Honesty and Disclosure

- **REQUIRE SRT TO SIGNAL DEGRADED, SUPPRESSED, OR FAILSAFE CONDITIONS VISUALLY AND UNAMBIGUOUSLY**
- **FORBID SRT FROM MASKING FAILURE, UNCERTAINTY, OR SYSTEM LIMITATION**
- **REQUIRE VISUAL HONESTY OVER USER COMFORT AT ALL TIMES**

---

## Continuous Presence

- **REQUIRE SRT TO MAINTAIN CONTINUOUS PRESENCE CONSISTENT WITH SYSTEM STATE EVEN DURING SILENCE**
- **DECLARE SILENCE AS A VALID OUTPUT BUT NEVER A STATELESS CONDITION**
- **REQUIRE SRT TO ALWAYS COMMUNICATE “SYSTEM IS AWARE” THROUGH PRESENCE OR STATE**

---

## Single Source of Truth

- **REQUIRE ALL SRT STATES AND TRANSITIONS TO BE CONSUMABLE BY UI, VOICE, LOGGING, AND EXTERNAL SYSTEMS**
- **REQUIRE A SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH FOR SRT STATE DERIVED ONLY FROM SCING NEURAL**
- **FORBID LOCAL UI, CLIENT, OR RENDERER FROM ALTERING OR OVERRIDING SRT STATE**

---

## Immutability and Review

- **LOCK THIS SRT AVATAR STATE TAXONOMY AS CANON AND IMMUTABLE**
- **PROHIBIT ANY AVATAR, SKIN, RENDER MODE, OR PLATFORM FROM INTRODUCING NON-CANON STATES**
- **REQUIRE CANON REVIEW AND VERSION UPGRADE FOR ANY CHANGE TO THIS TAXONOMY**
