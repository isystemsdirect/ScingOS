# Scing-Centric UX Specification

## Vision
The core of SCINGULAR OS is a persistent digital companion: the Scing bot. It receives voice commands, queries intelligence, and displays contextual results as the exclusive interface for users. Mechanical interaction is minimized; voice control is primary.

---
## Main Components

### Scing Bot Interface
- Central, floating avatar: visually present at all times, ready to interact.
- Wake phrase detection: "Hey Scing!" brings the bot to attention.
- Conversational UI: AI-driven natural language dialogue handles all queries, instructions, and feedback. Results delivered as dynamic overlay cards/panels.

### Result Display
- Floating information cards: Appear around the bot, context-aware. Results (photos, data, reports, social content) surfaced proactively or on request.
- HUD/AR overlay mode: Inspection or camera-driven scenarios render data directly onto camera view; Scing floats in HUD.
- Voice narration: Content can be read aloud; hands-free by default.

### Minimal Mechanical Input
- Touch/gesture only for critical actions: Security confirmations, emergency navigation, biometric approvals. Swipe/tap Scing for shortcuts when necessary.
- No traditional OS chrome: Menus, windows, or navigation bars replaced with bot dialog and floating overlays.

## Example User Flows

1. Inspection: "Hey Scing, begin report." Scing activates sensors, records, logs events automatically. All findings surfaced visually/hands-free.
2. File Retrieval: "Hey Scing, show last week’s images." Gallery appears, voice filters available.
3. Social Post: "Hey Scing, post status to team." Confirms, edits, posts—all by voice unless final tap required per BANE.

---
## Accessibility
- High-contrast themes; large text for field use.
- Speech-to-text and text-to-speech everywhere.
- Visual gesture aids where needed.

---
## Adaptive Layout
- Mobile/Tablet: Floating bot, overlays scale to fit; touch fallback.
- Desktop: Larger central avatar, multi-window result handling.
- Industrial/Field Equipment: AR/HUD mode, minimized UI, voice-first essential.

---
## Security
- BANE-enforced permission: All voice-driven actions go through dynamic audit and confirmation.
- User can review/approve logs; all bot actions are cryptographically signed.

This UX specification serves as a blueprint for SCINGULAR OS interfaces; iterate as functionality and field feedback evolve.
